what is this project?
<p>
this website can help you keep track of all the activity across your collaborative playlists.
once logged in, you will be able to see who added what song by what artist to which playlist how long ago. and it's all sorted chronologically! just keep scrolling to travel back in time. while you browse the page periodically checks if anything has happened and, if anything has, will automatically adjust your feed and tell you. no refreshing required.
</p>
why is this project a thing?
<p>
there's a good chance this isn't something you want or need. however if you and peers enjoy actively making use of the collaborative playlist feature then this is supposed to serve you as a fairly easy and comfortable way of keeping up with recently added songs across a large quantity of playlists.
</p>
is this it?
<p>
this is a passion project i work on in my spare time. i am aware the current version is very basic but more features are planned and in development. if you want more information or are looking to contribute feel free to check out the <a href='https://github.com/sebastian-stubenvoll/spotify-collab-tracker' target='_blank'>the github page</a>.
</p>
why is my playlist not showing up?
<p>
spotify has recently changed their implementation for collaborative playlists requiring users to explicitly invite other collaborateurs. while this is ultimately a good thing as it does prevent bots from invading collaborative playlists, spotify has not chosen to update their API to reflect this new collaboration system. while i hope that this update is going to happen in the near future, for now this website will only show playlists created using the old collaboration system (i.e. those where anyone with a link can add new songs).
